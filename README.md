## Network Address Translation
**Network address translation (NAT)** is a function by which ***IP addresses within a packet are replaced with different IP addresses***. This function is most commonly performed by either routers or firewalls.
The original intention of NAT was, like **classless interdomain routing (CIDR)**, to slow the depletion of available IP address space by allowing many private IP addresses to be represented by some smaller number of public IP addresses. Since that time, users have found NAT to be a useful tool for network migrations and mergers, server load sharing, and creating "virtual servers." This section examines all these applications, but first describes the basics of NAT functionality and terminology.
